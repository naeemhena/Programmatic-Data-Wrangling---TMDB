### 'Analyse the TMDB data to highlight some factors contributing to the success of a movie'

Project Title: Programmatic Data Wrangling - TMDB Movie Success Analysis 🎬

Author: Hena Naeem

Project Goal:
To analyze The Movie Database (TMDB) dataset to identify key factors that contribute to a movie's commercial and critical success. The project investigates the influence of budget, genre, production company, language, and popularity on a film's revenue and popularity.

Key Questions Explored:

What makes a movie successful?
Success in cinema isn't just about a massive budget; it's a multifaceted equation. My analysis provides a framework to understand the interplay of financial investment, genre appeal, and production choices. Is it the budget, popularity, genre, production company, or language? How can we quantify success through Return on Investment (ROI)?

Using a dataset of nearly 5,000 films, an end-to-end analysis, from raw data to actionable insights. Here's a snapshot of approach:

Data Wrangling: Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values and parsing complex nested JSON structures to extract usable features like genre and production country.
Feature Engineering: Created a new Return on Investment (ROI) metric to quantitatively measure a film's financial success, moving beyond just revenue.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigated into the relationships between budget, revenue, and other factors, building the foundation for powerful visualizations.
